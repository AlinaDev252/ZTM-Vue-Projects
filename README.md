# ZTM-Vue-projects
This repository contains a list of projects from Zero To Mastery Academy which helped me gain knowledge about some basic concepts of Vue (binding classes, conditional rendering, dynamic components), as well as Transitions and Animations.
For each project, I have created a new branch where the code can be found.
